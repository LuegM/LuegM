### MantaLog

#### Project Overview:
MantaLog represents my journey into iOS app development, intertwining my passion for diving with my enthusiasm for tech. It's more than just a dive log; it's an experience tailored for the modern diver.

##### Technical Highlights:
*Platform & Tools:* Developed for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI.
*Data Management:* Leveraged CoreData and SwiftData for efficient data storage and retrieval.
*Synchronization:* Integrated iCloud Sync, ensuring seamless data synchronization across all iOS devices.

##### Key Features:
*Bluetooth LE Integration*: Effortless syncing with dive computers for accurate logging.
*Emergency Functions*: Added safety layers for those unpredictable dive situations.
*Dive Insights & Stats*: Dive patterns, depths, and location statistics for a comprehensive dive review.
*License Storage*: A digital wallet for divers to store and showcase their diving credentials.

`Creating MantaLog has been an enriching experience, bringing together the thrill of diving with the precision of app development.`
